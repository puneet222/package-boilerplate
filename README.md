# Package-Boilerplate
This boilerplate code helps the user to speed up the development of package creation in the workerb application.
With the prerequisites already in, there is no need to configure anything to save the developer's time.

## Get Started Immediately
You don't have to configure any tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured so that you can focus on creating a package.

Just clone the project and install the dependencies and you're good to go.
